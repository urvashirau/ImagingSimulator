Done - Replace controls for weighting with one that smoothly go from uniform to natural via the 'robust' weighting implementation. 

Done - Add controls for observing bandwidth 

- Add noise (Tsys) with a control for the level, plus the correct math that accounts for 'more data' when the hourangle range is increased.

- Add finite dish diameters and get primary beams and the whole Area/Tsys effect on the image noise.

- Add a filled aperture option. See if there's an easy way to visualize the relation between the PSF and the PB.

- Show true images somewhere.

- Add amp and phase visibility errors : This would need a change to the way gridding is done.
